### Introduction

Hello! In this post, I’d like to share a quick story about my experience trying out Neovim, a text editor that is often the talk of the town among developers.

### The Reason Behind This Exploration

Why Neovim all of a sudden? The reason is quite simple: using Linux just feels incomplete without ever touching this particular text editor.

So, I mustered the courage to give it a try. Honestly, as a beginner, the first experience was pretty confusing (but exciting!). I had to Google everything just to learn the basic commands. From how to enter edit mode and block text, to the most crucial thing of all: how to actually exit Vim without killing the terminal!
