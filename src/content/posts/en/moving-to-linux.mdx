### Introduction

Hello everyone! In this post, I would like to share my experience deciding to migrate from Windows OS to Linux, specifically using the Kubuntu distro.

### Reasons for Switching

There are two main reasons why I finally left Windows and switched to Kubuntu. First, I wanted to try a new atmosphere and face a new challenge in computing. Second, considering that update support for Windows 10 will soon be coming to an end, I felt this was the right time to look for a more "long-term" operating system alternative.

### Why Choose an Ubuntu Derivative (Kubuntu) Instead of Arch?

The reason is quite simple: familiarity.

For me, the Ubuntu ecosystem feels more familiar because I have experience tinkering with Android using Termux. The basic command lines in Termux are very similar to the Debian/Ubuntu family. Since I was already accustomed to those commands, I felt that an Ubuntu-based distro was a much more reasonable and friendly choice to start with, compared to diving straight into an Arch-based distro.
